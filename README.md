# CS 445/545 Final Project
This the repo for my CS 445/545 Machine Learning final project.

# Scope
Classification of the Poker Hand data set.

# Tools
Basic Keras/Tensorflow Neural Network with the ability to add any number of hidden layers/nodes/activation features.

# Results
Middling. Neural Networks do not perform well on this specific dataset, and mine was no different. Experiment 1 adjusted the number of hidden layers while keeping the same activation. Experiment 2 kept similar hidden layers but changed activations. Experiment 3 kept same number of layers and activation but adjusted number of nodes (via Dropout or otherwise). 

# Future Work
More research/fine tuning of hyparameter scope.
