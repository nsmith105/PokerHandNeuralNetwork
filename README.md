# CS 445/545 Final Project
This the repo for my CS 445/545 Machine Learning final project.

# Scope
Classification of the Poker Hand data set.

# Tools
Basic Keras/Tensorflow Neural Network with the ability to add any number of hidden layers/nodes/activation features.

# Results
Middling. Neural Networks do not perform well on this specific dataset, no matter the hyperparameters.
